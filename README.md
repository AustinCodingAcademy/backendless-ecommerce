# Intro
The purpose of this project is to build a Amazon.com like ecommerce website using the front end skills that we should possess by now.
We do not have any backend skills so we are going to build 
this project using a technique called [serverless architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html)

We do not know how to build a backend server yet but that does not matter. 
There are plenty of companies who have already built servers and will rent them out to anyone who signs up.
We are going to use a website called [backendless](https://backendless.com) to be our server. 
Eventually we will need to learn how to build our own server so we dont' rely on another company.
